# burningmail24.live
A free email subject line generator.

## About
[burningmail24.live](https://burningmail24.live)
is a free website that uses a locally hosted language model to generate custom subject lines for emails.
While privacy and security are top priorities, we want to put emphasis on usability — thus, _burningmail24.live_ is built to be simple, and a little bold.

### Privacy & Security
Your data stays yours.
We run our own self-trained LLM to ensure high-quality generation, and all traffic is SSL-encrypted.
No user data is stored; only system and performance metrics are monitored.
We build things the way we’d want to use them — with integrity and care for good engineering.

## Contribution
The project is open source, but active development remains in our hands.
